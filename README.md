# Shopify Developer Test

Create a carousel slider, based on provided lrecording.

All elements of the shared in recording should be functional, it's up to you how they will work at the end.

Usage of GIT is required. Create a repository for this task, solution for each STEP should be in a separate branch in your repository 

Create a shopify store that you will use for this test.

### Considerations

- The documentation starting on the README.md file need to be clear
- We want to see not only the solution but also how you think and your working process, so please keep all your commits accessible and use proper naming standard for them
- All steps are required so do not skip any. If you don't know, or don't feel comfortable in required technology, just try your best and commit what you can

### Recording

You can find layout of a page in `/recording` catalog. 

### Description

- Title and the collection for the slider should be customizable from theme editor in shopify
- Should be able to move this component between template and pages.
- Carousel slider should be responsive
- Arrows should be available on Mobile and Desktop and try to create the same design as in the reference link shared.
- Dots should show only on mobile
- When a user clicks the “Add to cart” CTA on a slide, Should show a popup modal. The modal should show the price and title and the image of the added product. and modal should have two buttons, one to "CONTINUE SHOPPING" and one to " GO TO CART" and the current total of the cart count and cart total price.
- And if the product has multiple variants instead of "ADD To CART", you need to replace the button with "SELECT OPTION" and this button should navigate to the respective product page.
- Additionally the cart count bubble in the header should reflect when you add a product.
- When the page loads, the slider should n't break the design. What I mean is that the product slide card should not be jumping around or you can use a loader while the slider loads. (Try to avoid Cumulative Layout Shift ).

### Deployment

We would like to see application online. Deploy it to your test shopify store.

### Wrapping up

In the README file, we should be able to find all the information necessary to run the project, the different challenges, and the test. Documentation is highly important for the resolution of this test.

### Delivery

We expect to get GIT repository and shopify test store access.

If your repository is private, please share it with daniel.rosiak@chalhoub.com.

If your store is password protected, please share access credentials.
